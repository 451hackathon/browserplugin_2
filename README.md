## Project and Goals:

### Champions: 
Niels ten Oever (ARTICLE 19), dkg (ACLU), Joe Hall (CDT)
### Background: 
HTTP error code 451 (RFC7725) is an error code to report legal obstacles for serving a webpage. During the hackathon we will focus on implementing and measuring this status code to make censorship more transparent.
### Purpose: 
As part of ietf99, a browser plugin which would report to the user, and optionally to the webcrawler, cases of HTTP error code 451
